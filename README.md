Let's make pixel art!

Pixel arts always have their charm. Be it for your thumbnails, pic collection, emoji, or even game assets, pixel art suits any usage. It can be downloaded as SVG, JPG or PNG.

Use this tool to create the pixel art in common pixel art resolutions (8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 & 64x64). Click the download button afterwards to instantly download the SVG, JPG or PNG formats. There is no backend, it is a complete static frontend webapp which is very lightweight. None of your creations leave your device.

Instructions:
Select the color and click on the cells to draw. Clicking again cycles through 3 levels of transparency. Click and draw option is also available to create strokes (better to zoom in at higher resolutions). The black circle in white background denotes transparent cell. Right click to make a cell transparent. Click on reset button to clear the grid completely.

The tool is free, but you can support me by sharing the app with others.
